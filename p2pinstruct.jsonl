It likely represents molecular simulations or protein aggregation patterns, with each model displaying different spatial arrangements of particle clusters. The color scale indicates some physical property (possibly energy or density). The visualization demonstrates how parameter M affects structural organization, with simpler patterns on the left evolving to more complex, heterogeneous structures on the right. This type of figure would typically appear in biophysics or computational chemistry literature to illustrate model sensitivity to a control parameter.\n</figure_0>\n\n<figure_1>\nThis figure shows three molecular visualizations (panels A-B-C) of what appears to be protein structures with color-coded elements representing different properties. Each panel displays a complex 3D molecular structure with color gradients indicating likely energetic or interaction characteristics. Small inset diagrams show the overall protein conformation. The color scales at the bottom suggest these are computational analyses of protein stability or binding interactions, potentially displaying mutation effects or structural variations. This visualization would be used in structural biology or protein engineering research to compare conformational states.\n</figure_1>\n\n<figure_2>\nThis figure depicts the secondary structure of a ribozyme or RNA molecule, showing its complex three-dimensional folding. The main image presents a detailed molecular structure with helical regions (labeled H73-H93) and various structural features including the L1 stalk, CP (central protuberance), and P-loops. Key functional elements like the 5-way junction and exit pore are highlighted in teal. The smaller diagram on the right provides a schematic representation of the RNA's base region. This visualization likely illustrates the architectural organization of a functional RNA, possibly ribosomal RNA, to demonstrate its catalytic or structural domains in biochemical literature.\n</figure_2>\n\n<figure_3>\nThis figure illustrates the structural components of ribosomal subunits in molecular detail.

The middle panel depicts the small subunit with its platform, head, body regions, and functional elements like hinges and the decoding center. The right panel provides a classification of helical stacking patterns (basal/apical) and lists nucleotide positions for various structural elements (trunks, branches).

The color-coding represents different properties (likely energy or density values) according to the rainbow scale shown at bottom right. Each image demonstrates increasing complexity or phase transition as the parameter value increases. This visualization likely appears in biophysics, statistical mechanics, or computational chemistry literature to demonstrate clustering behavior, aggregation phenomena, or phase transitions in complex systems.\n</figure_5>\n\n<figure_6>\nThe figure shows three molecular models (A, B, C) of porphyrin structures with different metal coordination centers, likely from research on biomimetic systems.

The left side presents the 3D molecular structure with labeled helices (H73-H93), while the right side shows a simplified 2D schematic of the base region. Key structural elements are highlighted in red and labeled with identifiers (H74-H89), with functional regions marked in teal text (P-loop, 5-way junction).

The left panel shows the large subunit with labeled features including the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), L7/12 stalk, and L1 stalk. The middle panel depicts the small subunit with its platform, head, body regions, and functional centers (decoding center, ratchet, hinges). The right panel provides a legend identifying specific ribosomal proteins and RNA helices (B1-B17) with their corresponding numbering. Color coding (red/blue) appears to distinguish different molecular components, likely representing RNA nucleotides or specific structural elements.\n</figure_8>\n\n<figure_9>\nThis figure displays three reconstructed neuronal trunk-branch structures labeled with different time periods (H37-H38, H41-H45, H76-H79).

In \ncontrast, predictions from extant features in a handful of \nstructural models of LSU rRNA support its origin in the \npeptidyl transferase center (PTC) and protein biosynthesis \n[5,6]. The algorithmic nomothetic model assumes that the \nancient ribosomal core evolved by a series of putative \ninsertions of ‘branch’ helices onto preexisting coaxially \nstacked ‘trunk’ helices, which appeared to originate in the \nPTC [6]:\nIt  also  assumes  an  ‘onion’  model  of  growth  that \npervasively  builds  the  molecules  inside-out.

Analysis of a \n‘family A’ 3-way junction connecting a long helical coaxial \nbranch  that  supports  the  PTC  to  a  trunk  (H76-H79) \nsubtending  the  L1  stalk  and  its  translocation  functions \nreveals a branch-to-trunk insertion assignment that is in \nconﬂict with the PTC-centered accretion model. Instead, the \ninsertion supports the ancestral origin of the crucial L1 \ntranslocation structure (Fig. 2). Similarly, insertions linking \nterminal coaxial trunks that subtend the L7-12 stalk (H41-\nH45) and structures of the central ribosomal protuberance \n(H37-H38)  to  a  7-way  junction  of  the  molecule  again \nquestion  the  early  origin  of  the  PTC.  These  trunks  are \nparticularly important to both ribosomal translocation and \nenergetics. Analysis of branch-to-trunk directionalities of \ninsertions of domain V of LSU rRNA reveal that even the \nearly evolution of the PTC does not follow the algorithmic \nmodel (Fig. 3).  \nGlobal analysis of rRNA insertions reconcile the \nphylogenetic an algorithmic models of growth. \nOnce assumptions of ‘onion’ layering are relaxed, models \nare reconciled and the origin of the ribosome is in structures \nsupporting ribosomal mechanics, followed by the PTC and \nthe exit channel (Fig. 4).\nRoadblocks to an apical growth model of rRNA. \nThe  analysis  of  all  coaxial  stacked  helices  reveals  that \nmacromolecular accretion does not always occur via apical \n(outward)  growth  of  terminal  helices  (Fig.  5).  Instead, \nbasipetal (inward) growth appears also common. The data \nsuggests  a  dynamics  of  inward-outward  growth  that \ncompromises, in the absence of phylogenetic information, \nthe  construction  of  an  unequivocal  insertion-based \nalgorithmic  model  of  accretion.  Instead,  coaxial  helical \nstacking patterns suggests scenarios of grafting of extensive \nrRNA  segments  or  accretion  from  a  primordial  core \ncomposed of multiple growing rRNA molecules.  \nFig. 2.

The  evolutionary \ntimeline inferred directly from phylogenomic data shows that very early in evolution (nd \n< 0.3) rRNA helices interacted with r-proteins to form a processivity core, which later (nd \n= 0.3) served as center for coordinated and balanced ribonucleoprotein accretion.\nResults \nMethods \nConclusions \nFig. 5. Roadblocks to apical growth. Patterns of coaxial helical stacking in rRNA deﬁne ‘branch-\nto-trunk’ directionalities that violate the ‘onion’ apical growth model [5,6]. Secondary structure models of \nSSU and LSU rRNA of the Escherichia coli ribosome are depicted with schematic representations of helical \ntracts (lines) and junctions (circles). Unambiguous coaxial helical stacking regions in 3-way and higher order \njunctions associated with putative sites of insertions [6] were indexed by examining structural models and \nconﬁrmed by consulting descriptions of others (e.g. [7-9]). Coaxial helical stacking regions exhibiting inward \n(basipetal) and outward (apical) branch-to-trunk insertion directionalities are colored red (roadblocks) and \nblue(throughfares),  respectively.  When  travelling  from  the  base  (arrowhead)  to  the  periphery  of  the \nmolecules, basipetal directionalities violate the ‘onion’ model. Stacked helices in B3, B4 and B9 subtend \nfundamental structures supporting translocation mechanics of the large subunit and stacked helices B11 \nsubtend half of the PTC. Patterns of coaxial helical stacking falsify an origin of the ribosome in the PTC [12]. \nAnalysis of coaxial helical stacking present in SSU and \nLSU rRNA was guided by careful annotations of coaxial \nhelical  stacking  regions  that  are  present  in  ribosomal \njunctions  of  3D  rRNA  models  [7-9].  Fig.  2  shows \nexamples of trunks deﬁned by coaxial helical stacking.\nFig. 4. Reconciling models of LSU rRNA evolution. A.

The central relationships show that both Operation and Data \"has topic\" connecting to Topic, while Operation \"has input/has output\" connected to Data. Format \"is format of\" Data, and Identifier both \"is identifier of\" and \"is a\" relationship to Data.
